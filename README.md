This project includes different parts and levels of access that I will mention here:

<li>
    **Guest**:
      The guest has the lowest level of access among all types of users. He can only visit the store, look at the details of games and accessories, read comments and votes, and find out about the developers of that game or accessory.

<li>
    **Normal User**:
      A normal user has a wallet, library, friends, and privileges.
      He can go to the store and see the comments, votes, complete, and developer information, etc. of his product and choose his product.
      if he likes it and has enough money, he can buy it, vote and comment. olso he can send a feedback of the specefic version of the game to the developer.
      the purchased product will be added to his library. It is also placed in the community of that product and he can see other users who have bought that product and Send them a friend request.
      This request is saved in the other party's inbox. Also, the user who applied can be informed about the latest status of his request. If the opposite user accepts the request, the two will become friends.
      firends can see their purchased products and even share their money or games.

      Each user has a username, password, email, phone number, and ID.
      All these values ​​(except the password) are checked before the final approval and creating a user account so that they are unikue.
      The password is also checked to make sure it is strong, that is, it has upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.
      In addition to being unikue, the email must be in a standard email format.
      The phone number must also be unikue and in the form of Iranian phone numbers.
